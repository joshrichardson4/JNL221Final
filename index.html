    <p>College Football is not like other collegiate athletic programs. In College Basketball, especially during the NCAA tournament, we see lesser known schools have the ability to compete with and sometimes beat Power Five and Mid-Major schools, while coming from underfunded programs who may not give as much attention to basketball or athletics as a whole compared to their opponents. In College Baseball, the same process occurs. This gives those schools the ability to compete and showcase their skills and get more recognition and funding for their respective programs, but there is a dramatic difference between those sports and the way college football operates.</p>

  <div class="four">
    <p>The NCAA separates college football into two subdivisions: FBS and FCS. FBS schools are bigger, more well regarded, and have better programs than FCS. Some examples of top FBs programs are Washington, Alabama, Michigan, Texas, and many other Power Five schools. FCS on the other hand are smaller schools, with significantly less money, and in some cases much more rural areas. Examples of Top FCS schools are Montana, Idaho, North Dakota St., and South Dakota St. Money helps determine fitness for conferences and levels of play for College Football. With all this being said, it is still common to see some FBS schools schedule games with FCS schools early in the season as it helps with funding, sponsorship and media rights opportunities, and is an exposure opportunity for players and coaches.</p>

    <p>The difference between how FBS and FCS schools control their revenue markets and manage their expenses are quite similar, one just has more money to work with. Reggie Terry, the Senior Associate Athletics Director at Boston College, said that the key is efficiency. <p>“You want to be cost conscious. Whether you have $100 or $100 Million, you want to manage the same approach,” he said. “You want to maximize your spending.”</p></p>

    <p> It is more common to see FCS schools focus more primarily on things directly in their control to generate revenue. Daniel Schubert, the Associate Athletic Director for Strategic Communication & Tickets at Stetson University, said that the best way to do this is to create a positive relationship with the fans. <p>“I think it's allowing those experiences when our fans are at the games to meet these athletes. I think that's something we can offer that's maybe different than UCF which is 40 minutes down the road,” he said. “I think that'll help us draw them back into our facilities, get them engaged in the program, and once they're engaged, you know the smallest gift is the first gift.”</p></p>

    <p> The last few years have drastically changed aspects of business opportunities for these programs and all of college athletics due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The dramatic decrease in total revenue and total expenses is evident in the graphs above. For Terry and BC, the difference was noticed in the fans, specifically lack thereof. <p>“Those were dollars missed in concessions.” However, the lack of fans was made up for due to the increase in media rights and availability. “The thing that the SEC and ACC did was we played. We played 11 games, whereas the PAC-12 and the BIG-10 didn't; they only played 6,” he said. “The revenue definitely dropped by the lionshare from a TV perspective and a conference perspective stayed intact given we played a whole season.”</p></p> 

  <p> While the ACC and Power 5 schools were able to stay manageable with their money and collect that revenue elsewhere, Stetson has a large reliance on tickets, which took a dramatic drop due to the pandemic. Now, as they try to get that money back, Schubert does not believe that people are considering Stetson into their monetary budget the same way they did before 2020. <p>“I think people got used to your screens and your TV and your online sources such as your ESPN+ and such. I think in terms of tickets, I think that money went elsewhere,” he said. “At what point does a family go ‘Okay we used to spend $500 on Stetson tickets, now I'm spending $500 elsewhere for my kids to maybe play sports or something’, they're not factoring Stetson in now, because they didn’t for that COVID period of time.”</p></p>

<p>As college athletic programs progress to going back to normal with their budgeting, spending, and revenue markets, it is important for them to realize how much money they have to use, how much money they are bringing in, and what they can do to make the most with what they've got. </p>
